Lab 2: Titanic Survival Prediction🚢
Platform:Kaggle Dataset

Project Overview:
This project explores the historical Titanic dataset to identify patterns and factors that determined passenger survival. By applying machine learning techniques, we aim to move from raw data to meaningful predictions about a passenger's outcome.

Machine Learning Problem

Type: Binary Classification.

Goal: To predict the survival status of a passenger (Survived vs. Not Survived).

Target Variable: Survived

Problem Statement:
Given a set of passenger demographics and travel information, can we accurately predict whether a person would have survived the Titanic disaster? This project focuses on building the foundational workflow required to answer this question.
